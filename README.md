# DCGRacer

DCGRacer is a simple physics-based race game, using LibGDX/box2d for the physics, and artemis-odb for the Entity Component System. Its primary goal is to teach myself basic game development.

# Status

Mostly still in Proof of Concept state. Player can be controlled using keyboard or touchscreen. There is an auto-generated landscape. There are some prototype graphics. Player can actually die. But other than that, there is no game play and the code base is rough.
